gender-swapper 
-------

A simple tool that swaps genders in written English text. 

Uses the online natural language [Text Processing API] (http://text-processing.com).

Meant to study how gender-specific the treatment of a character is in a given written work. Closely analyzing a gender swapped text often helps provide a better understanding of what plot elements are tied stringly to the character's gender. Analyzing multiple works by one author can help generalize about any gender bias in his or her writing.

## Usage


You may run the (very rudimentary) provided TKinter GUI.

Alternatively, you can use module flip_file or flip in `genderflipper.py`:

```python

from genderflipper import flip, flip_file

names = {'sherlock': 'irene', 'holmes': 'adler'}
flip_file("input.txt", names)

```

```python

from genderflipper import flip, flip_file

names = {'sherlock': 'jane'}
flip("To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman.", names)

```

An internet connection is required.
